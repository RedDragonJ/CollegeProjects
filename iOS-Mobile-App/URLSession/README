Here just a quick demenstration of URLSession usage. However, this is not a best way to put the HTTP request code.
The proper way should create a data modal class to handle all there process and viewcontroller should never
have access to the URLSession code. Also URLSeesion will automatically execute this request in the background 
thread so no need to do anything samiliar.

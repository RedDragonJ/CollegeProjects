This project demostrate the use of NSURLConnection, however it also can use NSURLSession, AFNetworking, or other RESTful API.

The data handle can use CoreData, sqlite, or plist depend on the situation. But i just temp store data on memory instead for now.

The UI can be improved by use custom views for better user experiences.
